## XYZ Insight?

Maybe you want to build a XYZ Insight tool/website from another data source rather than GitHub, but bother with and get lost in the large amount of tools: MySQL -> Sharding Middlewares -> ETL Tools -> OLAP Database or Spark/Hadoop  way...,

The workshop here is telling the answer.


## Easy to build

For TiDB (MySQL compatible), it is **SUPER EASY** to handle both:
1. a primary rdbms to <u>handle high concurrency</u> and <u>real-time insert/update</u>
2. analytical scenario to <u>provide insights</u>

(Even the data size is 100TBi+)

## Examples:

* [mini OSS Insight](./mini-oss-insight)
* [Stack Overflow Insight](./stack-overflow-insight)
* [Twitter Insight](./twitter-insight)
