## Help Build XYZ Insight

Maybe you want to build a XYZ Insight tool/website from another data source rather than GitHub, but bother with and get lost in the large amount of tools: MySQL -> Sharding Middlewares -> ETL Tools -> OLAP Database or Spark/Hadoop  way...,

The workshop here is telling the answer.


## Simple Architecture & Few Steps

For TiDB (MySQL compatible), it is **SUPER EASY** to handle both:
* act as a **primary** rdbms to <u>serve requests in high concurrency</u> and <u>insert/update in realtime</u> (transactional row-storage)
* provide analytical ability to <u>get insights</u> (analytical column-storage)

(Even the data size is 100TBi+)

And we only need 3 steps to setup a demo:
1. Find Data Srouce
2. Load Data to TiDB or TiDB Cloud
3. Get Insights with SQL
