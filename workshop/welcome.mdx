If you want to build **Another Insight** tool with another data source except GitHub, then you're in the right place. This workshop will tell you it's not too hard to get insights from big data, expecially **big data with realtime insert/update**. Use a HTAP database here is suitable. because it is **SUPER EASY** to handle both:
* act as a **primary** rdbms to _serve requests in high concurrency_ and _insert/update in realtime_
* provide _analytical ability to get insights_

There is a 10-minute post to explain [why we choose tidb to support ossinsight](/blog/why-we-choose-tidb-to-support-ossinsight). but for saving time we put a picture below which shows the architecture difference between "before" and "after" we use TiDB:

  <img width="70%" src={require('@site/blog/why-we-choose-tidb-to-support-ossinsight/how-different-db-handle-github-data.jpg').default} alt='Simplified architecture after we use TiDB' />
</center>
<center><i>before and after we use TiDB</i></center>

<br />

Usually, with enough abstration, there will be 3 steps to setup such an insight system:

1. Find its Data Srouce
2. Load Data to TiDB
3. Get Insights with SQL

(You can use MySQL instead of TiDB in step 2, but you should will meet with performance issues soon...)

OK, for saving time, join the bellow workshops asap, each one will follow the above 3 steps!  üèÉüèÉüèÉ
